# Parahita API Base URL
# Base URL for the Parahita Medical Lab Assistant API (no trailing slash).
# 
# Usage:
# - Leave unset (empty) to use relative paths (/api/parahita/*) which work with:
#   * Proxy in development (package.json proxy field)
#   * Vercel rewrites in production (vercel.json)
# - Set to full URL if your API is on a different domain:
#   * Local: http://localhost:3000
#   * Production: https://api.example.com
#
# Note: If using HTTPS frontend, the API must also be HTTPS or use relative paths
# to avoid mixed-content blocking.
#
# Example:
# REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
# REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://api.parahita.com

# Development server configuration
# Avoid "allowedHosts[0] should be a non-empty string" when running the dev server (e.g. with proxy)
